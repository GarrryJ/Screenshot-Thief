# Screenshot-Thief
#### Every 5 seconds the app takes a screenshot and in a separate thread sends it to you on the DropBox using your access token.
Screenshots are saved in "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.png" format.


You need to specify your access token in the Main.java class:
```java
  private static final String ACCESS_TOKEN = "<ACCESS TOKEN>";
```
 Have fun!
